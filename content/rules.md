As I am living in a D/s relationship with Xir, we wrote down some rules for my behavior which I have to obey unconditionally:

- Lauras body is property of her Xir, and must be treated as such with frequent shaving and care.
- Laura must make her bed every time she leaves the bed after sleeping.
- Laura must shave, wash her face and brush her teeth every morning and every evening.
- Laura must **always** respond within one hour of receiving a text from Xir, except when sleeping.
- Laura must **always** ask for permission to orgasm.
- Laura must present her wrists for handcuffs whenever asked to.
- Laura may dress like she feels like, except when Xir wishes for specific (or the removal of) clothing.
- Laura must create a time-schedule for the next day, before going to bed. She is required to write down her emotional wellbeing and thoughts into a journal. In addition she is to reflect on how the day went and compare it to the schedule that was made the day before.
- Laura is required to sleep from 22:00 - 07:00 on weekdays and from 00:00 - 09:00 on the weekend.
- Laura is required to take her morning medication until 07:45 on weekdays and until 10:45 on weekends. Her afternoon medication must be taken by 21:45 on weekdays and until 23:45 on weekends.
- Laura must eat breakfast until 10:00 on weekdays and until 11:00 on the weekend, and must eat a healthy snack at most five hours later.
- Laura must answer every question asked by Xir truthfully and may not be ashamed in front of Xir.
- Laura may be bratty unless sheâ€™s called a fucktoy. Once she is called a fucktoy she must be absolutely obedient.
- Laura must be on her knees, without underwear, in the [nadu position](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nadu) awaiting the coming home of Xir. She may not look at Xir until allowed to.
